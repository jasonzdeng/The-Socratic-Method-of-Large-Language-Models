# Iterative Enhancements Roadmap

## Q3 2025
- **Options & derivatives analytics**: Extend quant workspace with option Greeks, implied volatility surfaces, and risk scenario modeling for derivatives-heavy portfolios.
- **Multi-lingual debates**: Introduce translation layer and localized judge personas to support cross-border discussions (Mandarin, Japanese, Spanish).
- **Source credibility scoring**: Integrate citation quality heuristics, weighting sources by historical reliability and market impact.

## Q4 2025
- **Structured knowledge graphs**: Build GraphRAG ingestion for company relationships, supply chain dependencies, and regulatory actions to improve multi-hop reasoning.
- **Portfolio sandboxing**: Allow users to upload custom portfolios and run LLM-guided stress tests with historical market shocks.
- **Scenario replay mode**: Provide curated replay of past debates (e.g., AI industry earnings) with meta-analysis of successful strategies.

## 2026 Outlook
- **Agent personalization**: Adaptive agent personas that learn analyst preferences, risk appetite, and favored models while preserving compliance boundaries.
- **Hybrid human-in-the-loop**: Introduce human moderator checkpoints for high-stakes decisions, supported by explainability dashboards.
- **Third-party plugin ecosystem**: Expose SDK for external data/tool providers to integrate seamlessly with the Socratic debate engine.

## Evaluation & Feedback Loop
- Schedule quarterly user councils to surface high-impact feature requests.
- Maintain KPI scorecards (accuracy, consensus time, cost efficiency) to guide prioritization.
- Run A/B tests on debate strategies (e.g., debate depth, judge configurations) to quantify performance gains.
